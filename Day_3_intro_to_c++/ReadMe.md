        - what is inside <iostream>
        - use case of "using namespace std"  & why we need to use this smalll project & avoid big projects (name collisions)

        - use cases of return 0 and non-zero

        - Print 6*3 in output, donâ€™t print 18, just 6*3 should be in the output screen.
        - If we have only 4 bits, How 3 and -6 will be written in 4 bits.
        - If we have only 5 bits, How 13 and -16 will be written in 5 bits.
